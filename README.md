# open_risk_taxonomy

The Open Risk Taxonomy is an **open source risk classification framework** developed by Open Risk. 
The primary objective of the taxonomy is to support the development of a comprehensive and consistent 
set of open source _risk models_. 

## Format 

The taxonomy consists of a set of files in declarative format (currently JSON)


The taxonomy is also used as one of the organizing principles for entries in the [Open Risk Manual](https://www.openrisk.eu/risk_manual/Risk_Taxonomy)
Other risk management uses may well be possible.

## Resources

An interactive exploration of the taxonomy is available [here](https://www.openrisk.eu/risktaxonomy/index.php) .
