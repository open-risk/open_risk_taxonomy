# Open Risk Taxonomy

The Open Risk Taxonomy is an **open source risk classification framework** developed by Open Risk.

The primary objective of the taxonomy is to support the development of a comprehensive and consistent 
set of open source _risk management tools_ and _risk models_. 

## Format 

The taxonomy consists of a set of files in declarative format (currently JSON)

## Usage Examples

The taxonomy is used as one of the organizing principles for entries in the [Open Risk Manual](http://www.openriskmanual.org/wiki/Risk_Taxonomy)
